# cat_and_dog_classifier
As an intern at Bharat Intern, I developed a Cat and Dog Classifier using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and achieves high accuracy in classification.
